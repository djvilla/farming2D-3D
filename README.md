# Farming 2D-3D Game :seedling:

A farming game similar to *Harvest Moon* I am attempting to create in Godot. I have playing around with a 2D sprite style within 3D environment.
An example of this kind of style would be *Pokemon Diamond & Pearl* or *Pokemon Black & White*.
So far, the game has nothing but a character moving around a chunk of floating land with the ability to till the dirt tiles.

Eventually, I am going to refactor this code with some new techniques I have discovered to help make the code easier to understand and use.
For now, its a neat experiment to look at.

## How to run

1. Before you can run the game, you are going to need at least [Godot 3.2.3](https://godotengine.org/download/windows) at the time of writing.
2. Once you have the engine downloaded go ahead and open up the project.
3. Under the file system open up the folder *Scences* (Misspelling will be fixed eventually I promise) and open *World.tscn*.
4. Press the "F6" key.

Congrats, the game compiled and is now running!
